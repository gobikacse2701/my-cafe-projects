    <p>Black coffee is low in calories and contains small amounts of several vitamins and minerals, along with plant compounds like caffeine and chlorogenic acid.

    <p>A cappuccino is made with equal parts of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam. It has a strong coffee flavor with a creamy texture from the milk and foam. A latte, on the other hand, is made with more steamed milk and less foam compared to a cappuccino.</p>

    <h3>Espresso</h3>
    <img src="{% static 'espresso.jpeg'%}">
    <p>Espresso is thicker and more intense than coffee because of the lower grounds to water ratio, the finer grind, and the pressurized brewing method. Regular coffee uses a coarser grind, more water and gravity to extract the final brew.

        <img src="{% static 'machito.jpeg'%}">
    <p>The small amount of milk that is used in the macchiato gives this coffee drink a slight sweetness. However, the combination of sweetness and creaminess of the milk isnâ€™t enough to dilute the strength of the espresso, so some may argue that a macchiato can taste slightly bitter.</p>
